I love reading and learning, so I've compiled a list of books that helped me a lot, some of them were simply transformational.
I preffer to have a clear and proven learning track, so I mostly focus on timeless classics instead of following trends and the most recent publications.

__Disclaimer:__ I recommend __studying__ these books, and __learning__ from them, __not just reading__. This means __reading more than once__, __taking notes__, __trying out__ the concepts in real life, trying to __link the new knowledge to the one you already have__ (to make learning effective).

# Leadership

# [Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-audiobook/dp/B015TM0RM4)
Demonstrates why taking total responsibility is the cornerstone of effective leadership (and personal growth). A fun read if you enjoy military stories.

I can't put into words how much this book has affected me. I fell in love with the idea of Extreme Ownership, that we are responsible for every aspect of our lives and we must act accordingly. This doesn't mean ignoring the reality, but rather focusing on the things under our control. Though hard, but through discipline, it's liberating to take ownership of your life.

Takeaways:
- __Ownership Starts at the Top__: Leaders must own every outcome and take responsibility for successes and failures, never shifting blame to subordinates or external circumstances.
- __There are no Bad Teams, only Bad Leaders__: A direct connection exists between the leader’s mindset and the team’s performance — when the leader adjusts approach, the team’s results can transform dramatically.
- __Believe in the Mission__: Leaders must internalize and believe in the mission's purpose; if they are uncertain or lack conviction, the team will sense it, causing misalignment and low morale. They also must make sure their team understands and believes too - this is the leader's responsibility.
- __Check the Ego__: Ego can blind leaders to reality, disrupt team unity, and prevent collaborative problem-solving; recognizing and subduing one’s ego is essential.
- __Simplify Plans and Communication__: The more complex a plan or message, the higher the likelihood of confusion and error; leaders must simplify instructions to ensure everyone understands roles, goals, and execution steps.
- __Prioritize and Execute__: In complex, high-pressure situations, leaders must discern the most critical task and tackle it first before moving on to the next.
- __Cover and Move (Teamwork)__: Different departments or individuals support one another to achieve overarching objectives rather than only their own tasks.
- __Decentralized Command__: Empowering each person to lead within their realm of responsibility prevents leader overload and fosters more agile decision-making.

# [The Dichotomy of Leadership: Balancing the Challenges of Extreme Ownership to Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin](https://www.amazon.com/The-Dichotomy-of-Leadership-audiobook/dp/B07BN5NGQ5)
A follow-up to Extreme Ownership, in the same engaging style. The key message: find balance in all things.

# [Hal Moore on Leadership: Winning When Outgunned and Outmanned by Harold Moore](https://www.amazon.com/Hal-Moore-on-Leadership-audiobook/dp/B078KLYRPV)
Translates battlefield lessons into practical insights on inspiring and guiding others.\
My main takeaway: Colonel Hal Moore used to go on a long run before making a tough decision to gain clarity.

Takeaways:
- __Put Your People First__
- __Lead by Example__
- __Prepare Relentlessly__
- __Stay Calm Under Pressure__
- __Cultivate Moral and Ethical Foundations__
- __“There’s Always One More Thing You Can Do” Mindset__
- __Clear, Concise Communication__
- __Accountability and Ownership__

# [Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action by Simon Sinek](https://www.amazon.com/Start-with-Why-Simon-Sinek-audiobook/dp/B074VF6ZLM)

In Start with Why, Simon Sinek argues that truly influential leaders and organizations begin by defining a clear purpose—“why” they do what they do—before explaining the “how” and the “what,” thereby inspiring loyalty, innovation, and sustained success.

Takeaways:
- __The Golden Circle__: Sinek introduces the Golden Circle model—Why, How, What—to explain how the most inspiring leaders and organizations place “why” (their core purpose) at the center of everything they do, guiding strategy and communication.
- __Importance of Purpose__: By starting with a compelling “why,” leaders can tap into deeper motivations and emotions, fostering stronger loyalty and commitment from employees, customers, and partners.
- __Inspiration Over Manipulation__: While many organizations rely on incentives or fear-based tactics (“manipulations”) to drive short-term results, the truly great ones focus on inspiring people to act, generating lasting trust and engagement.
- __Leadership and Trust__: Leadership rooted in clear purpose and authenticity naturally builds trust; people follow leaders who are genuine in their beliefs and transparent in their intentions.
- __Consistency and Clarity__: Organizations must consistently align their processes, products, and messaging with their core purpose—this cohesiveness reinforces “why” at every level and keeps both internal teams and external audiences inspired.

# [Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear-audiobook/dp/B07RFSSYBH)
Offers practical steps for developing small, consistent habits that grow into significant results. A cornerstone read for high performance.

Takeaways:
- __Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results__: Consistent improvements of just 1% each day accumulate into significant outcomes over time, proving that small actions are more powerful than large, infrequent efforts.
- __Focus on Identity, Not Just Goals__: Effective habit change involves adopting an identity that aligns with your desired behavior.
- __Design Your Environment__: Reshape your surroundings to make good habits obvious and bad habits less convenient.
- __Use the Habit Loop__: Leverage the cue–craving–response–reward cycle to create or break habits. Provide clear triggers (cues), harness motivation (cravings), establish simple actions (responses), and reinforce behavior (rewards).
- __Habit Stacking and the Two-Minute Rule__: Pair a new habit with an existing habit.
- __the Two-Minute Rule__: Begin each new habit with a small, manageable action to reduce friction and make it easier to follow through.
