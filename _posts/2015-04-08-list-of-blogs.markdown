I've seen a lot of people asking how to keep up to date with the iOS dev community, so I decided to share a list of websites I try to visit frequently:

## Must read

-   **[NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/)** - used to be my favourite iOS dev blog until [The Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt) decided to [pass the main editor
    role](http://nshipster.com/changing-of-the-guard/) to Nate Cook (Jan 2015). Still a very good source of information
-   **[objc.io](http://www.objc.io/)** - a very professional site where the editors choose different subjects and write a suite of serious and well documented articles about those subjects (i.e.[Lighter View Controllers](http://www.objc.io/issue-1/), [Concurrent
    Programming](http://www.objc.io/issue-2/), [Architecture](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/), \...). Highly recommended
-   **[Mike Ash\'s NSBlog](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/)** - Mike Ash is the first name that pops into my mind when I think about iOS\'s low level architecture and what happens behind the curtains and most importantly, being able to explain those concepts to regular developers. This blog has a lot of interesting articles explaining in detail how certain platform concepts work (i.e. [Let\'s build @synchronized](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-02-20-lets-build-synchronized.html),[Secrets of
    dispatch\_once](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2014-06-06-secrets-of-dispatch_once.html), [Why Registers Are Fast and RAM Is Slow](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-10-11-why-registers-are-fast-and-ram-is-slow.html), ...)

## Aggregators

This contains a list of blogs that aggregate articles from other sites.

-   **[iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com/)** - a list of the hottest articles/controls/news\... that appears weekly (as the name says)
-   **[iOS Goodies](http://ios-goodies.com/)** - another weekly list of the hottest stuff from iOS dev
-   [iOS developer:tips](http://iosdevelopertips.com/)
-   [Maniac Dev](https://maniacdev.com/)
-   [Cocoa Controls](https://www.cocoacontrols.com/) - searchable list of open source UI controls (with description, screenshots, \...)
-   [iOS Programming @Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/)

## Tutorials

The best place to look for iOS Dev tutorials is [**RayWenderlich.com**](http://www.raywenderlich.com/). Another tutorials platform is [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com/) (note
that some tutorials need to be purchased). Also see [iOS Bytes @ CodeSchool](https://iosbytes.codeschool.com/) or [CocoaHeads TV](http://cocoaheads.tv/).
