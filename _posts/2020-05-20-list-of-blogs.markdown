I've seen a lot of people asking how to keep up to date with the iOS dev community, so I decided to share a list of websites I try to visit frequently:

## Must read

- **[Swift Talk](https://talk.objc.io)** - A weekly video series on Swift programming.
  This has become my #1 source of iOS information and inspiration, I really enjoy Chris and Florian's approach of different problems, the way they balance elegant solutions with high-end concepts with sometimes just making something work first.

- **[NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/)** - has a long history behind it, still one of the top blogs for developers

- [Apple Developer News and Updates](https://developer.apple.com/news/) - official news from Apple directly

- [Erica Sadun's site](https://ericasadun.com/) - a blog from one of the top developers out there

## Aggregators

This contains a list of blogs that aggregate articles from other sites.

-   **[iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com/)** - a list of the hottest articles/controls/news\... that appears weekly (as the name says)
-   **[iOS Goodies](http://ios-goodies.com/)** - another weekly list of the hottest stuff from iOS dev
-   [Maniac Dev](https://maniacdev.com/)
-   [Cocoa Controls](https://www.cocoacontrols.com/) - searchable list of open source UI controls (with description, screenshots, \...)
-   [iOS Programming @Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/)

## Tutorials

The best place to look for iOS Dev tutorials is [**RayWenderlich.com**](http://www.raywenderlich.com/) or **[Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com)**

## Intersting Blogs

-   [Ole Begemann iOS Development](http://oleb.net/)

## Stack Overflow

Of course, the [iOS tagged questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios) cannot be missing from this list. You can learn a huge amount from there.
