I just came across a great tool, called [Faux Pas](http://fauxpasapp.com/).

> *Faux Pas inspects your iOS or Mac app's Xcode project and warns about possible bugs, as well as about maintainability and style issues.*

It\'s in Beta right now, so everyone can download it for free and play with it.

How it works:
- you just select an Xcode project and it will analyse all the content,
using a set of rules you can enable/disable

Why I liked it:
- you can enable/disable the rules, rules which are indeed based on best practices
- the rules are documented, with examples and links to documentation (Apple Docs, Stack Overflow, \...). What else could we ask for?
- besides simple checks like duplicate images, bad usage of prefixes or IBOutlets declared in the public interface of a class, it checks for more complex stuff like:
  - Setter invocation in `init` or `dealloc` method
  - Modifying the value of an argument variable
  - Moving common inclusions into prefix header
  - Method swizzling
  - `NSLog()` used in release build
  - Class implements `-isEqual:` but not `-hash`
  - Conflicting category methods
  - and many others
- it comes with a command line set of scripts that can be easily integrated within Xcode or your Continuos Integration system

Just give it a try, it will definitely help you.
