### Who am I

As a software developer with over 16 years of experience, I am a seasoned professional.
For the past 14+ years, I have been developing for Apple platforms (mainly iOS).

### Passion for development

For fast and reliable app delivery, I'm passionate about using automated tests, clean code, architecture, and design patterns. I am guided by the principles of continuous improvement and continuous improvement.
As an Instructor at the Essential Developer iOS Academy, I am currently helping other iOS developers learn these principles and practices.

### My experience with open source

A lot of my experience is due to contributing to open-source projects like SDWebImage or CocoaLumberjack.

### Giving something back

Over the years, I have learned a lot from many people, and this blog is an attempt to give some of that back. 
Our unique journey makes us experts in some areas, but we can always learn from others.
If you want to really learn about something, prepare to teach it to others :)
