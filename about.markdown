### Who am I

I am an experienced software developer, I live and work in Cluj-Napoca, Romania and for the past 10+ years I've been doing iOS apps development.

### Passion for development

I'm passionate about the Swift and Objective-C languages, code architecture and ways to write clean code, how to automate different aspects of the development cycle (coding, testing, delivery, documentation, ...).

### My experience with open source

I'm a big fan of open source projects and I owe a lot of my experience to contributing to open source. Ever since I became a core member of projects like [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) or [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack), I was constantly exposed to developers with different backgrounds, different cultures and their many many coding challenges :) Trying to help them was a journey each time and has offered me occasions to learn different things that I would have never thought about while just developing apps. Plus you get a great feeling when you get to see how many people actually use that project and that they do enjoy it.

### Giving something back

Over these years, I learned a lot from many many people, so this blog is an attempt to give some of that back. 

I do believe our journeys makes each one of us expert in some area and we can always learn something from anyone.

Plus, if you want to really learn about something, you just need to start writing about it :)
