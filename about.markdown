Based on my last years of experience, I think I can call me an Objective-C developerÂ passionate about iOS and Mac OS technologies, community and much more. I enjoy contributing to open source (I\'m a maintainer for projects like [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) or [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack)).

I can\'t say I\'m writing the best iOS blog, I can definitely say I will write an honest blog, mostly based on my experience.
